# Can of books backend

**Author**: Michael Dulin, Joel Myrtil
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->

## Estimates

<!-- See below -->

## Logistical

- What hours will you be available to communicate? 
    - 9 to 9
- What platform will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)? 
    - Slack, Discord and phone
- How often will you take breaks? - At least once an hour
What is your plan if you start to fall behind? - We will regroup and figure out what we are stuck on. Then, we will use appropriate resources to figure out

## Cooperative

Make a list of each person’s strengths. - Michael: Problem solving, code implementation - Joel: Teamwork, patience
How can you best utilize these strengths in the development of your application? - While pair programmin, we will have the other person walk the driver through their logic to teach them
In what areas do you each want to develop greater strength? - We both would like to improve upon our ability to work with React as well as handling databases
Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand the code, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day development? - We will work today explaining any new implementations as well as utilize pair-programming

## Conflict Resolution

What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing? - Since there are two of us, we will hold eachother accountable
What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute? - We will ensure proper task managment and split up the work appropriately
How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level? - We will compile our product together at all times
